SNAP Version 1.06
6/25/2015

SNAP Version 1.06 includes minor revisions to allow SNAP to be pre-processable
for inclusion/exclusion of MPI and OPENMP.

Summary:
The SNAP files time.f90 and plib.f90 have been renamed time.F90 and plib.F90.
Each file includes pre-processing directives depending on the definitions in
the make system 'MPI' and 'OPENMP'. The Makefile has been modified to set
the definitions and use a pre-processor to analyze the *.F90 files, convert
them to *.f90 files, and compile.

To build without MPI and/or OPENMP:
gmake MPI=no OPENMP=no

The default build assumes MPI=yes and OPENMP=yes.

Files:
R plib.f90
A plib.F90

Add dummy routines that perform little or no operations in place of the
normal "wrapper" routines around calls to MPI and/or OPENMP. Add preprocessing
definition to evaluate at compile time.

R time.f90
A time.F90

Add preprocessing definition within the wtime subroutine for case with/without
MPI.

M Makefile

Include preprocessing DEFS. Set FORTRAN and OMPFLAGS based on conditions
specified to make command.

M version.f90

Update version and date.
