SNAP Version 1.09
04/18/2019

SNAP Version 1.09 includes minor revisions to the previous version of SNAP
released to GitHub.

Summary:
SNAP 1.09 includes one feature request addition. SNAP now reports the number
of words allocated, which when multiplied by the number of bytes per word
(i.e., 8 for double precision), allows the user to quickly assess how much
memory SNAP is using. It does not include the size of stack memory. This
information can be found at the bottom of a SNAP output file or by searching
for the phrase "Allocated words".

The Makefile has also been lightly modified to use less aggressive optimizations
for the GFORTRAN configuration. As always, users may modify the makefile
options that suit their own needs. This change effectively reverts changes
made for v1.08.

The copyright statment has been previously updated to reflect the change in
management of Los Alamos National Laboratory to Triad National Security, LLC.

Please direct questions to the SNAP developers for finer details of the code
changes.
